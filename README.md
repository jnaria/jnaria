- 👋 Hi, I’m @jnaria
- 👀 I’m interested in cooking, baking, gardening, and spending time with friends.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++. I have learned a bit of Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have the strongest foundations in C++ and HTML/CSS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment.
